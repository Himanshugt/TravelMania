## All About Travel Mania

We have designed and implemented a software system that allows travel agencies to maintain their travel packages’ itinerary and passengers. The software is designed in Java with extensive use of MySQL database and Object-Oriented Programming. 
The Java application interacts with JDBC API, which uses the JDBC Driver to connect to MySQL Database. 
The software has been tested using the Junit 5 unit testing framework, which was integrated with Mockito. The classes and methods have been successfully tested, including the testing of void methods.
